# websocket-full-demo
Source code for my medium artical called "Simple chat application with Spring WebSocket and AngularÂ 10"

## How it works
Firstly, colne this repository in your local machine via **git clone https://github.com/kyaw-codes/websocket-full-demo.git**.

You will have two directories: 
- websocket and
- websocket-client

The directory named 'websocket' is a server-side spring boot project and 'websocket-client' is a client-side Angular app. 

To install required node_modules 'for websocket-client', run the following command
> npm i

This will install all the dependencies required for your client-side Angular app.
